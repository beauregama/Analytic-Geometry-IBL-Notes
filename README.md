# Analytic-Geometry-IBL-Notes
These are notes to do an analytic geomtery course at the precalculus level in an Inquiry Based Learning environment.
Included in this are the main tex file (Analytic_Geometry_IBL_Notes.tex), the JIBLM style file (slightly modified from the style file from the JIBLM source), and graphics files (mostly .png).
